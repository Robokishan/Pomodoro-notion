###  Purpose

Pomodoro is very well known technique to practise productivity. People like me who uses notion very aggressively has to learn some templating system. Now I must assume that out there, there will be much more usefull templates should be there for notion + pomodoro templates. 
But i wanted to make much more than that. I wanted to leverage notion apis and build more kind of an app that can help me and others like me who wants to learn notion apis and have combination of all the apps in one app. best of both world . So i built this app for that same purpose to stay productive and to stay focused and build timeline based on my notion database tasks list. This is also my internal day to day personal Tool. I have added some noises as well from https://freesound.org/ to stay productive in calm environment.
